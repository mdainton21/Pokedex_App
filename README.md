#Pokemon App
    ##Overview
        This is a simple web application using Javascript that allows users to view a list of pokemon and view details on each of the pokemon by clicking on them.
    ##Features
        This app loads a list of pokemon with their name, id, and picture. Clicking a specific generation of pokemon on the navbar will cause the current list to be replaced by the new generation's list. By clicking on a specific pokemon within the list, a modal will appear with more info on the pokemon such as type, height and weight.
